### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My public repositories mainly include academic work that has been submitted.

I strongly believe in creating projects with the goal of getting people to use it, as opposed to creating project for the sake of creating projects.

**That is why my most important repositories are private as this makes the projects have the potential of being a sustainable business.**

Most repositories will be made public once I am no longer actively working on them.

You can find more deatils on these projects on my website: [mnm-matin.github.io](https://mnm-matin.github.io/)
